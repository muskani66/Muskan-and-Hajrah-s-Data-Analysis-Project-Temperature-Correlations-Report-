# Muskan-and-Hajrah-s-Data-Analysis-Project-Temperature-Correlations-Report-

In our course, ICS4U, for our data analysis temperature correlation project, we decided to choose one out of the four csv files named, “Global Land Temperatures By Country”. The simple reasoning is since we wanted to see the effect of climate change on the earth throughout the years 1970-1979 from all the countries to get the maximum amount of knowledge. Instead of using the other three files which were strictly for a certain city/state we wanted to take this data and look at it from a global standpoint. We drew 3 correlations within this csv, one being the average temperature rise between the countries, one was the tempreture rise within winter and summer months, and the last was how the urban and rural populations effected the temperature. Leaving more rural countries to have less of a dramatic change in their climate, whereas urban was the opposite. More information is provided in the report as well as the commenting section of the code. We have commented and referenced everything we took from online and hope you enjoy reading and looking at the various graph trends!
